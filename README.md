## Sections in the Report
Report has multiple section's from where you can manage the data, like :
- Report data can be sliced by Segments, Country and Year to show particular data.
- Report has cards showing Total Units Sold, Total Gross Sale and Total Profit.
- Report has a clustered bar chart with year on x-axis and profit on y-axis showing profit quarterly.
- And lastly, Report has a area chart showing months on x-axis and profit on y-axis showing profit monthly.
- I have also included a Reset button at the top to clear all slicer's.
- To use it hold CTRL and then click it to reset all the slicer's.
